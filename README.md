How to Run  

References: Inspiration for this project began with reading the article, "Did the illicit fentanyl trade experience a supply shock?"; DOI: 10.1126/science.aea6130; https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aea6130. Much of the data and methodological approach from the mentioned article was a launching pad for my own investigation.
